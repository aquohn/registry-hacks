# registry-hacks
Registry editor files sufficiently annoying to create that I felt obligated to share them.

An exercise in wrangling with Windows' internals and mutilating code and ideas from all over the internet.

For now, these scripts simply allow you to install registry entries that add MSYS2 here and PowerShell here prompts to the Windows extended context menu (shift-right click to access; normal PowerShell can be accessed from there too).

Yes, I know they're in a folder with a space in the name. That's the point: they work even there.
